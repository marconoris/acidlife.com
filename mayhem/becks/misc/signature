"Anyone who slaps a 'this page is best viewed with Browser X' label on a Web page 
appears to be yearning for the bad old days, before the Web, when you had very little chance of
reading a document written on another computer, another word processor, or another network." 

					     -Tim Berners-Lee in Technology Review, July 1996
