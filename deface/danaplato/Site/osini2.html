								<td align="center" class="verdana11" valign="top"><div align="justify">I was at a party with a friend of mine and we were picking up a pair of girls. They both seemed interested in the matter and the most beautiful one was rubbing herself against my friend. But when we realized that a Joy Division video was being projected on the other side of the hall, my friend went to enjoy the vision on his own. I don't know why he was so attracted by that twenty year old b/w out of focus shitty video, in which people seemed to have turned up on a stage by error. What did that band mean to him? Maybe he was listening them the first time he made love, or the day before his exams, or in a period of depression… It doesn't matter. In that moment his gaze was literally lost in the void. He came back only after the credits dissolved. Unfortunately the two girls had already gone but he didn't care too much. In a way he had just experienced the sight of God. Who has been madly in love with music knows what I mean.</div></td>
