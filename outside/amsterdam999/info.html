	waiting for my plane home. <br>
	It was the third time I was there, actually it was just another one day walkaround 
	for the third time in my life. <br>
	I love that town. It does not shine in the magnificent lights of Paris, it does not
	recall the ragged beauties of London, and it does not share the ancient charm with
	Rome. <br>
	I love it the way I enjoyed Prague. It possess the gift of joining peace and art, 
	emotions and joy. And, hard to believe I know, I did not smoke a single joint! 
	<BR>
	I portrayed the city shooting its people. I used my old full manual SLR on a couple 
	of Kodak T400cn B/W films rated ad 250 ISO. <br>
	As I did not carry with me the winder, I found myself never taking unnecessary 
	bracketed pictures of the same scene. I mostly used the 50mm lens, and only 4 of the
	20 shots were taken with a 135mm. I had the film processed by a pretty standard  
	photofinisher and I acquired the prints using my cheap off-brand A4 scanner. Some of 
	the pictures you can see in this site would deserve a better electronic refinement, 
	but, because of my chronicle lack of time, I cannot resist the temptation of showing
	them off today. <br>
	I should also point out that these photographs were merely intended as documentation,
	not art. Let us call it "reportage".<BR>
	I just wanted to show the city as I could feel it in my hands (I always feel something 
	touchy when I release the shutter). <br><br>Just my personal vision.</font></p></td></tr><tr>
