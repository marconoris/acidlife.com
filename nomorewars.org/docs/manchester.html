            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Alice Mahon MP 
            said: `The conference will launch an international campaign for the 
            NATO states which are responsible for the destruction of the 
            civilian infrastructure of Yugoslavia to pay for the reconstruction 
            of the hospitals, schools, electricity generators, water treatment 
            works, factories, roads and bridges which they destroyed. NATO 
            claimed that it had no quarrel with the civilian people of 
            Yugoslavia. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>`In addition, we 
            will be arguing that all refugees, Albanian and Serb alike, receive 
            urgent humanitarian aid and that all ethnic cleansing cease - which 
            requires the immediate disarming of the KLA, not a delay of 90 days 
            while Kosovar Serbs are driven from their homes. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>`Finally, we 
            will be considering the consequences for world peace of NATO's 
            violations of international law by unilateral military action, and 
            its new strategic concept adopted in April which provided for future 
            military actions by NATO outside of any framework of international 
            law.' </FONT></P></TD></TR>

            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The Committee 
            for Peace in the Balkans said today: </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>'By refusing to 
            implement the provisions of the UN Security Council resolution 
            providing for the demilitarisation of the KLA, NATO is ensuring that 
            tens of thousands of innocent Serb civilians are being ethnically 
            cleansed from their homes in Kosovo. </FONT><FONT 
            face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Radio Free Europe on 16 
            June quoted US Army General John Craddock as stating that possible 
            KLA disarmament is up to the &quot;discretion&quot; of the 
            respective peacekeeping troops and that: &quot;Our soldiers are not 
            instructed to routinely disarm the KLA&quot;. German army spokesman, 
            Lieutenant Colonel Dietmar Jeserich was quoted in the same report as 
            stating: &quot;The KLA is walking the streets with its weapons, but 
            the authority lies with KFOR.&quot; </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>'NATO has more 
            than enough firepower to prevent armed KLA forces being deployed if 
            it wished to do so. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>'Therefore, as 
            in Croatia, the only possible conclusion is that NATO's policy of 
            allowing the KLA to terrorise defenceless Serb civilians is 
            deliberate. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>'In the context 
            of NATO's refusal to disarm the KLA, and with NATO permitting KLA 
            gunmen to set up road blocks and conduct house searches in many 
            parts of Kosovo, General Sir Mike Jackson's well publicised appeal 
            for Serbs to stay must be dismissed as a pure public relations 
            exercise to deflect western public opinion. Given that the military 
            commander of the KLA is being investigated by the War Crimes 
            Tribunal for his role in ethnically cleansing Serbs from Croatia, 
            the fears of civilian Serbs are obviously justified. 'In order to 
            reverse the present wave of ethnic cleansing, an emergency session 
            of the UN Security Council should be called to instruct the 
            international force in Kosovo, which is supposed to be under UN 
            control, to immediately demilitarise the KLA.'</FONT></P>
